### 🔥 About Me

I'm a driven and entrepreneurial computer science student passionate about **AI, mobile dev, and full-stack innovation**. I build tools that blend **machine learning** with **clean design** to solve real problems — from real-time sentiment apps to resource systems for schools. I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern @ **DEX Imaging**, building internal automation systems.

> 📈 My goal: Land a ML internship at a top-tier company and launch products that reach millions.
